# Chapter 8 Sampling Distributions

##  Statistical Inference

Any quantity computed from values in a sample is called a **statistic**.

</div>

<br>
What are the main "stats" we have learned?  
How do we know these "stats" are equal to the population?

<div class="notes">
Numeric Method  | Numeric | Categorical
------------- | ------------- | -------------
Center  | Sample Mean $\bar{x} = \frac{x_1+x_2+\cdots +x_n}{n} = \frac{\sum (x)}{n}$  | Sample proportion of success $\hat{p} = \frac {\text{number of S's in the sample}}{n}$
Variability  | Sample Standard deviation $s = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N-1} \sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \overline{x})^2}$  |   
Relative Standing Statistic  | Z SCORE $\text{z} = \frac{x- \bar{x}}{\sigma}$  |  
</div>

## Sampling Distribution

The observed value of a statistic depends on the particular sample selected from the population; typically, it varies from sample to sample. This variability is called **sampling variability**.

The distribution of a statistic is called its **sampling distribution**.

## Sampling Distribution of a Sample Mean

Let $\bar{x}$ denote the mean of the observations in a random sample of size n from a population having mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$.  

Denote the mean value of the distribution by $\mu_\bar{x}$ and standard deviation of the distribution by $\sigma_\bar{x}$ (called the standard error of the mean)

##  Properties

When random samples are selected form a population, the following are properties of the sampling distribution of $\bar{x}$.

1. $\mu = \mu_\bar{x}$ 
2. $\sigma = \frac{\sigma_\bar{x}}{\sqrt{n}}$  
This rule is approximately correct as long as no more than 5% of the population is included in the sample.
3. When the population distribution is normal, the sampling distribution of $\bar{x}$ is also normal for any sample size n.
4. When n is sufficiently large, the sampling distribution of $\bar{x}$ is approximately normally distributed, even when the population distribution is not itself normal. Central Limit Theorem.

## Practice in Excel {.smaller}

Let x be the amount of time (in minutes) that a particular San Francisco commuter must wait for a train.  Suppose that the density curve is as pictured.

```{r echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
df<-data.frame(x = c(0,20),Density = c(.05,.05))
dfb<-data.frame(x = c(0,20,40),Density = c(0,.05,0))
```
<center>
```{r echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.height= 2.5, fig.width=4}
ggplot(df, aes(x=x, y=Density)) + geom_line(size = 1) + scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0,25),name = "x - minutes") + scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,.15))
```
</center>

1. Create a sample of 30 commuters with the RANDBETWEEN(0,20) function in excel
2. What is the average of your sample?
3. What is the classes average of average samples?
4. Create 10 samples, plot the sample distribution and calculate $\mu_\bar{x}$ and $\sigma_\bar{x}$
5. According to sampling distribution properties, what are $\mu$ and $\sigma$?

## Central Limit Theorem

The Central Limit Theorem can safely be applied when n exceeds 30.

If n is large or the population distribution is normal, the standardized variable 

$$\text{Z} = \frac{\bar{x}- \mu_\bar{x}}{\sigma_\bar{x}} = \frac{\bar{x}- \mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} }$$

has (approximately) a standard normal (z) distribution regardless of the underlying distribution.

<div class="notes">
The average of averages is going to be normal.  Especially when n is large.
</div>

## Why does Central Limit Theorem (CLT) matter?

Results enable inferential statistics about a population mean even when the shape of the population distribution is unknown.

## Example with Different Population Distributions

Random data for 3 distributions with values of 0 to 100

```{r echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='hide'}
library(ggplot2)
set.seed(10)
dfa<-data.frame(Type = "Normal", x = round(rnorm(1000,mean = 50, sd = 10),0))
dfb<-data.frame(Type = "Uniform", x = round(runif(1000, 0,100),0))
dfc<-data.frame(Type = "Skewed", x = round(rnorm(1000,mean = 40, sd = 20)+runif(100, 20,30),0))
dfc$x[dfc$x>100]<-100
df<-rbind(dfa,dfb,dfc)
ggplot(df, aes(x, color = Type)) + geom_density(adjust = 3, size = 1) + labs(title = 'Distributions')

```

## Sample Distribution based on n

```{r echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='hide', fig.width = 9, fig.height = 6}
dfa<-data.frame(Sample = 1:100, Type = "Normal")
dfb<-data.frame(Sample = 1:100, Type = "Uniform")
dfc<-data.frame(Sample = 1:100, Type = "Skewed")
df_sample<-rbind(dfa,dfb,dfc)

clt<-function(sample_type, n)
  {
  mean(sample(df$x[df$Type == sample_type], size = n))
  }

df_sample$Sample_Mean<-mapply(df_sample$Type,2, FUN = clt)
plot1<-ggplot(df_sample, aes(Sample_Mean, color = Type)) + geom_density(adjust = 3, size = 1) + labs(title = 'n = 2')
df_sample$Sample_Mean<-mapply(df_sample$Type,5, FUN = clt)
plot2<-ggplot(df_sample, aes(Sample_Mean, color = Type)) + geom_density(adjust = 3, size = 1) + labs(title = 'n = 5')
df_sample$Sample_Mean<-mapply(df_sample$Type,10, FUN = clt)
plot3<-ggplot(df_sample, aes(Sample_Mean, color = Type)) + geom_density(adjust = 3, size = 1) + labs(title = 'n =10')
df_sample$Sample_Mean<-mapply(df_sample$Type,20, FUN = clt)
plot4<-ggplot(df_sample, aes(Sample_Mean, color = Type)) + geom_density(adjust = 3, size = 1) + labs(title = 'n = 20')

library(gridExtra)
grid.arrange(plot1, plot2, plot3,plot4, ncol=2,nrow = 2)
```

## Problem Example 8.15

Let x denote the time (in minutes) that is takes a fifth-grade student to read a certain passage.  Suppose that the mean value and standard deviation of z are $\mu = 2$ minutes and $\sigma = 0.8$ minutes, respectively.

1.  If $\bar{x}$ is the sample mean time for a random sample of n = 9 students, where is the $\bar{x}$ distribution center, and how much does it spread out (as described by its standard deviation)?
2.  What is the center and spread for n = 25 and n = 100?
3.  Which of the sample sizes would be most likely to result in an $\bar{x}$ value close to $\mu$, and why?

<div class="notes">
Problem 8.15  

1. $\mu_\bar{x} = 2$, $\sigma_\bar{x} = 0.267$
2. $\mu_\bar{x} = 2$ will always be 2.  For n = 25, $\sigma_\bar{x} = 0.16$.  When n = 100, $\sigma_\bar{x} = 0.008$
3. Since n = 100, has the smallest standard deviation it is most likely to have $\bar{x}$ be closer to $\mu$
</div>

## Sampling Distribution of a Sample Proportion $\hat{p}$
Let $\hat{p}$ be the proportion of successes in a random sample of size n from a population whose proportion of S's (successes) is p. Denote the mean of p by $\mu_\hat{p}$ and the standard deviation by $\sigma_\hat{p}$.

## Sample Proportion Properties

When random samples are selected from a population, the following are properties of the sampling distribution $\hat{p}$

1.  $\mu_\hat{p} = p$
2.  $\sigma_\hat{p} = \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}$
3. When n is large and p is not too near 0 or 1, the sampling distribution of p is approximately normal.
    + General rule if np and n(1-P) are greater than 10 then the sample distribution is normal

## Proporiton Practice

About 42% of adults plan on celebrating St. Patrick's Day and of those planning to celebrate about 25% plan on going to a St. Patrick's Day parade.  

1. Create a sample of 30 randomly selected adults and indicate if they are planning to attend a St. Patrick's Day parade.  
    + Use excel function =BINOM.INV(1, 0.1, RAND())
2. Based on your generated sample, what is $\mu_\hat{p}$ and $\sigma_\hat{p}$?
3. What would sample distribution of 25 samples look like if the sample size was changed to 50?
