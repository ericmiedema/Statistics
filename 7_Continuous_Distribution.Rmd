# Chapter 7: Probability Distribution

## Review - Random Variable

A numerical variable whose value depends on the outcome of a chance experiment is called a **random variable**. A random variable associates a numerical value with each outcome of a chance experiment.

* **Discrete** if the possible values are isolated points on the number line. 
* **Continuous** if the set of possible values form an entire interval on the number line.

## Uniform Distribution (problem 7.25) {.smaller}

Let x be the amount of time (in minutes) that a particular San Francisco commuter must wait for a train.  Suppose that the density curve is as pictured.

```{r echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
df<-data.frame(x = c(0,20),Density = c(.05,.05))
dfb<-data.frame(x = c(0,20,40),Density = c(0,.05,0))
```
<center>
```{r echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.height= 2.5, fig.width=4}
ggplot(df, aes(x=x, y=Density)) + geom_line(size = 1) + scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0,25),name = "x - minutes") + scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,.15))
```
</center>

1. What is the probability that x is less than 10 minutes?
2. What is the probability that x is between 7 and 12 minutes?
3. Find the value c for which P(x<c)=.9

## Triangular Distribution (problem 7.26) {.smaller}

Let x and y be waiting times on two independently select days.  Define a new random variable w as the sum of the two waiting times, w = x + y. 

<center>
```{r echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.height= 2.5, fig.width=4}
ggplot(dfb, aes(x=x, y=Density)) + geom_line(size = 1) + scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0,50),name = "w - minutes") + scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,.15))
```
</center>

1. What is the probability that w is less than 20 minutes?
2. What is the probability that w is between 10 and 30 minutes?  

Reminder: Area of a triangle = 1/2 base * height

## Normal Distribution  

A normal distribution with  $\mu_x = 0$ and $\sigma_x = 1$, is called the standard (or standardized) normal distribution.

```{r echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width = 9, fig.height = 4}
library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)
x<-rnorm(50000,mean = 0, sd = 1)
df<-data.frame(Value = x, Label = "Mean = 0")
x<-rnorm(50000,mean = 2, sd = 1)
dfb<-data.frame(Value = x, Label = "Mean = 2")
df<-rbind(df,dfb)
x<-rnorm(50000,mean = -2, sd = 1)
dfb<-data.frame(Value = x, Label = "Mean = -2")
df<-rbind(df,dfb)

plot1<-ggplot(df, aes(Value, color = Label)) + geom_density(adjust = 3) + labs(title = 'Mean Change')

x<-rnorm(50000,mean = 0, sd = 1)
df<-data.frame(Value = x, Label = "SD = 1")
x<-rnorm(50000,mean = 0, sd = .5)
dfb<-data.frame(Value = x, Label = "SD = .5")
df<-rbind(df,dfb)
x<-rnorm(50000,mean = 0, sd = 2)
dfb<-data.frame(Value = x, Label = "SD = = 2")
df<-rbind(df,dfb)

plot2<-ggplot(df, aes(Value, color = Label)) + geom_density(adjust = 3) + labs(title = 'Standard Deviation Change')

grid.arrange(plot1, plot2, ncol=2)
```

## Normal Distribution (Problem 7.82)

Suppose that the distribution of typing speed in words per minute (wpm) for experienced typist can be approximated by a normal curve with mean 60 wpm and standard deviation 15 wpm.

1.  What is the probability that a randomly selected typist's speed is at most 60 wpm?
2.  What is the probability that a randomly selected typist's speed is between 45 and 90 wpm?

## Steps to solving normal distribution problems

1.  Visualize Probability Density Function
2.  Calculate the Z score, $\text{Z} = \frac{x- \bar{x}}{S}$
3.  Find appropriate area(s)
    +  Estimate with empirical (68, 95, 99.7) rule
    +  Look up on normal table: [link to wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_normal_table), back of any statistics book or create your own.
    +  Calculate with excel formula =NORM.DIST(x,0,1,TRUE)
4.  Solve for probability

## Practice : Create your own Standard normal probability table

1. Normal Probability Density Function (PDF) graph
2. Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) graph
3. Challenge: Standard normal probability table  

Determine the following:  

1.  The area between 1, 2, 3 and 4 standard deviations:  How does this compare to the empirical rule?
2.  The area to the left and right of -0.68:  How do these areas compare?
3.  The area to the left of -1.2 and to the right of 1.2:  How do these areas compare?
