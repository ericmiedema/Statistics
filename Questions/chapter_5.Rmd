#### Homework Review

#####  Problem 5.2

Which of the following pairs of variables would you expect a negative correlation?

a.  Maximum daily temperature and cooling costs
b.	Interest rates and home loan applicants
c.	Incomes of husbands and wives when both have full-time jobs
d.  Height and shoe size

#####  Problem 5.16

In investigation on whether water temperature was related to how far a salamander would swim and whether it would swim upstream or downstream, collected data and generated a equation of y = 0.01614 x - 0.14282 where y = net directional and x = mean water temperature in degrees Celsius.

Based on the equation, what mean temperature would result in a prediction of the same number of salamander larvae moving upstream and downstream?

a. 0 degrees Celsius
b. 8.85 degrees Celsius
c. Negative 0.14 degrees Celsius
d. 0.016 degrees Celsius
e. Not enough information to calculate

#####  Problem 5.47

A study, described in the paper "Prediction of Defibrillation Success from a Single Defibrillation Threshold Measurement" (Ciculation [1988]: 1144-1149) investigated the relationship between defibrillation success and the energy of the defibrillation (expressed as a multiple of the defibrillation threshold).  Based on the data, 3 least squares regression was created using y unchanged.
