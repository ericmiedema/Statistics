The owner of an electronics store believes that the latest shipment of batteries contains more "dead on arrival" batteries than the usual 2%.  He tests the null hypothesis that the proportion of dead batteries equals 2% against the alternative hypothesis that the proportion is greater than 2%. The results of a simple random sample of 53 randomly chosen packages in this shipment are given by:

The CEO of a software company is interested in the effects of playing two different versions of a new video game on the pulse rate of players. Forty beta-testers were identified online to participate in the study.   
All 40 participants measured their at-rest pulse rates. Each participant will play each version of the game for twenty minutes. The experimenter flips a coin to determine which version each participant will play first. All participants get sufficient rest between gameplay to allow their pulse rates to return to their normal at-rest states.   
The experiment then compares elevation in pulse rate resulting from playing version 1 to elevation in pulse rate resulting from playing version 2 for each participant.   
Which of the following statements is true?   

a. The design of the experiment is flawed because subjects were not randomly assigned to a control or an experimental group.
b. This is an example of a completely randomized comparative experiment without blocking.
c. This is an observational study and not an experiment, so no conclusion can be reached regarding the connection between version of the game and pulse rate that is characteristic of the overall population of video game players.
d. All observations in this study are independent.
e. Blocking is used in this study to reduce the difference in elevated pulse rates of the two observations for each individual participant.  <ANSWER>

Does playing the television during an 8-hour workday reduce a pet Siberian Husky dog's activity level during the day? An experiment was conducted where a group of Siberian Huskies was divided into two groups. The television was played in the household for one group, and it was not played for the control group.

a. We do not know the true decrease in activity level in Siberian Huskies due to television exposure, but we are 95% confident that the increase in the mean decrease lies in this interval. <ANSWER>
b. Because the confidence interval does not include zero, we are 95% confident that the true decrease in activity level in Siberian Huskies is 3.6 hours.
c. We are 95% confident that the average decrease in activity level in the sample is 3.6 hours.
d. Because the confidence interval does not contain zero, we are 95% confident that there was no effect of playing the television on decreasing activity level in Siberian Huskies.

Intercept | 4.2153 | 3.77 | 0.0071 | 1.2210
Dose | 5.3180 | 3.18 | 0.0215 | 1.6340   

The best fit regression line and 95% confidence interval for its slope are given by which of the following?

a. Regression Line: y = 5.3180 + 4.2153x  
95% CI for slope: 4.2153 $\pm$ 1.714(1.2210)   
b. Regression Line: y = 5.3180x + 4.2153   
95% CI for slope: 5.3180 $\pm$ 2.069(1.634)  <ANSWER>  
c. Regression Line: y = 5.3180x     
95% CI for slope: 4.2153 $\pm$ 1.96(1.634)   
d. Regression Line: y = 5.3180 + 4.2153x   
95% CI for slope: 4.2153 $\pm$ 2.069(1.2210)   
e. Regression Line: y = 5.3180x + 4.2153   
95% CI for slope: 5.3180 $\pm$ 1.714(1.634)

Newly-commissioned lifeguards at the local beach resorts must complete a timed exercise that simulates various rescue conditions. This exercise includes swimming out to the second buoy, dragging a 200-pound dummy to shore in the wake of a riptide, and providing resuscitation for 4 minutes.   
The times, in minutes, it takes to complete the exercise are recorded for a sample of 100 lifeguards. The mean completion time based on data collected for the past 5 years is 7.5 minutes. The examiner has reason to believe that this year's recruits are less physically-fit than in years past.   
To test this claim, what are the null and alternative hypotheses?

a. $H_0: \mu = 7.5$ verses $H_0: \mu \ne 7.5$
b. $H_0: \mu > 7.5$ verses $H_0: \mu = 7.5$
c. $H_0: \mu = 7.5$ verses $H_0: \mu > 7.5$ <ANSWER>
d. $H_0: \bar{x} = 7.5$ verses $H_0: \bar{x} < 7.5$
e. $H_0: \mu = 7.5$ verses $H_0: \bar{x} < 7.5$
