a.	Each t curve is less spread out than the z curve. <ANSWER>
b.	All t curves are bell shaped and each is centered at zero.
c.	The t curve approaches the z curve as the number of degrees of freedom increase.
d.	As the number of degrees of freedom increases, the spread of the corresponding t curve decreases.

##### 6.  When does the Central Limit Theorem state that the sampling distribution of $\bar{x}$ is well approximated by a normal curve?

b.	When the population distribution is not itself normal and n is greater than 30. <ANSWER>
c.	Only when the population distribution itself is normal.
d.	When the population is skewed.

##### 10. A rock gym manager used a random sample of 300 rock climbers to obtain a 95% confidence interval for the mean time (in minutes) it takes to complete a difficult climbing route. This interval was (12.2, 14.3). If he had used a 90% confidence interval instead, the confidence interval would have been _________

a. wider and would have involved a smaller risk of being incorrect.
b. narrower and would have involved a smaller risk of being incorrect.
c. wider, but it cannot be determined whether the risk of being incorrect would be greater or smaller.
