#### Concepts Review

##### Suppose R and T are two events, what is the event called in which R and T consists of all experimental outcomes that are in both the event R and the event T?

a.	It is called the conditional probability of R and T.
b.	It is called the complement of R and T. 
c.	It is called the intersection of R and T. <answer>
d.	It is called the union of R and T.

##### Which of the following statements correctly states the Law of Large Numbers?

a.	As the number of repetitions of a chance experiment decreases, the chance that the relative frequency of occurrence for an event will differ from the true probability of the event by more than any small number approaches 1.
b.	The Law of Large Numbers is any collection of possible outcomes from a chance experiment.
c.	As the number of repetitions increases for any experiment there is uncertainty concerning the result of the outcome.
d.	As the number of repetitions of a chance experiment increases, the chance that the relative frequency of occurrence for an event will differ from the true probability of the event approaches 0. <answer>

b.	independent
c.	mutually exclusive
d.	both mutually exclusive and disjoint <answer>

b.	dependent
c.	disjoint
d.	independent

##### Which of the following is the definition of the union of two events T and W?

a.	The union is the event consisting of all outcomes that are in both T and W.

c.	The union is the event consisting of all outcomes in either T or in W or in both T and W. <answer>
d.	The union is the event consisting of all outcomes that are not in both T and W.

Suppose the probability of event C is P(C) = 0.10 and the probability of event D is P(D) = 0.65.  If C and D are mutually exclusive then what is $P(C \cap D)$?

#### Homework Review

#####  Problem 6.11

An engineering construction firm is currently working on power plants at three different sites.  Define events $E_1$,$E_2$, and $E_3$ as follows:  

$E_1$ = the plant at Site 1 is completed by the contract date  
$E_2$ = the plant at Site 2 is completed by the contract date  
$E_2$ = the plant at Site 3 is completed by the contract date  

The following Venn diagrams pictures the relationships and different outcomes of these events.

Which of the following is **NOT** true?

a.  Diagram A represents at least one plant is completed by the contract date.
b.  Diagram B represents all the plants are completed by the contract date.
c.  Diagram C represents none of the plants are completed by the contract date.
d.  Diagram D represents only the plant at site one is completed by the contract date.
e.  Diagram E represents exactly one of the three plants is completed by the contract date.
f.  Diagram F represents that any 2 of the three sites are completed by the contract date. <answer>
