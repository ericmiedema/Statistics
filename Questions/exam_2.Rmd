#### Multiple Choice (2 point each): 1 pt for formula/showing work and 1pt for solution
##### 1. Years of data collection have shown that airport metal detectors will show a positive reading (which indicates the presence of metal) 1% of the time when no metal is present and 98% of the time when metal is actually present. Suppose that a random sample of 7 travelers is subjected to a metal detector. What is the probability that the metal detector will not show a positive reading for any of these travelers if metal is not present on any of them?

##### 2. Suppose 10 patients with meningitis received treatment with large doses of penicillin.  Three days later, temperatures were recorded, and the treatment was considered successful if there had been a reduction in a patient's temperature.  Denoting success by S and failture by F, the 10 observations are  

S S F S S S F F S S
